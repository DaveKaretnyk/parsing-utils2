Python 2.7.13 ANTLR grammar
---------------------------
Development: used original Python 3.3.X grammar from Bart Kiers then worked
through the official Python 2.7.13 grammar specification and made adjustments
(and some tidy up) accordingly.

The text files are the abstract and full grammar specifications for 2.7.13.
Get from the main Python site (below) along with the lexical specification.
